Question:
You are given the firstname and lastname of a person on two different lines. Your task is to read them and print the following:

Hello firstname lastname! You just delved into python.


Solution:

def print_full_name(a, b):
    A=[a,b]
    B=" ".join(A)
    print "Hello"+" " +B+ "!" +" " "You just delved into python."


if __name__ == '__main__':
    first_name = raw_input()
    last_name = raw_input()
    print_full_name(first_name, last_name)
    
    IMP:-use of .join just for revision
         appending the strings in list first and using join and string concatenation to solve this
         
         
         Thanks
