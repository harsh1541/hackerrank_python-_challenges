Question:-

You are given a string and your task is to swap cases. In other words, 
convert all lowercase letters to uppercase letters and vice versa.

Solution:-

def swap_case(s): 
    import string
    H=(string.swapcase(s))
    return H
    

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = raw_input()
    result = swap_case(s)
    print result
    
    
    IMP:-swapcase is a method which helps in doing interchanging. (i.e:- lower case to uppercase and vice-versa)
