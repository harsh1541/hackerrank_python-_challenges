Question:-
Given an integer,n ,n and  space-separated integers as input, create a tuple,n , of those  integers. 
Then compute and print the result of hash(t).




Solution:-
Hash values are just integers which are used to compare dictionary keys during a dictionary lookup quickly.

Internally, hash() method calls __hash__() method of an object which are set by default for any object. We'll look at this later.

Code:-


n = raw_input()
print hash(tuple([int(i) for i in raw_input().split()]))
